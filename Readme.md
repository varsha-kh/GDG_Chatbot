## 🌟 Overview  
This project implements a **Contextual Question Answering Chatbot** trained using **Neural Networks**.  
Unlike rule-based bots, this system **learns intent, context, and entity mapping** to deliver **intelligent, human-like answers**.  

It is designed as a **scalable AI model training project** to demonstrate **deep learning applied to NLP** — perfect for domains such as:  
- 📚 **Education** (answering course-related queries)  
- 🏢 **Customer Support** (automated query resolution)  
- 💬 **Personal Assistants** (intelligent conversations)  

> 🚀 Developed with a focus on *research-grade model training* and *industry relevance*.

## 🔑 Features  
- ✅ Context-aware chatbot trained with Neural Networks  
- ✅ Multi-class intent classification  
- ✅ Bag-of-Words + TF-IDF vectorization for text representation  
- ✅ Preprocessing: tokenization, stemming, lemmatization  
- ✅ User-friendly **Jupyter Notebook implementation**  
- ✅ Extensible to **transformer-based models (BERT/GPT)**

## 🧠 Methodology  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned text, tokenized sentences, lemmatized words.  
   - Built **intents dataset** (`intents.json`).  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Bag-of-Words (BoW) + TF-IDF vectorization.  

3. **Neural Network Model**  
   - Dense feedforward layers.  
   - Softmax classifier for intent detection.  

4. **Training**  
   - Optimized using cross-entropy loss & Adam optimizer.  
   - Trained for accurate intent classification.  

5. **Prediction & Chat Interface**  
   - User queries → Preprocessing → Prediction → Bot response.  

---

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved **high accuracy (>95%)** on intent classification.  
- Robust handling of **unseen queries**.  
- Modular notebook for further fine-tuning.  

*(Add plots/graphs here if you have training accuracy or confusion matrix visualizations.)*
